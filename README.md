# Key Drivers of Quality of Life
_Regression analysis of socio-economic drivers behind the Quality of Life Index_

This project analyzes how socio-economic factors influence a composite Quality of Life Index, using regression techniques to balance complexity and explanatory power.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Built multiple linear regression models to explore relationships between predictors and the Quality of Life Index  
- Applied Box-Cox transformations validated with likelihood ratio tests to improve model assumptions  
- Used forward and backward stepwise selection with adjusted R², AIC, AICc, and BIC to choose the optimal model  
- Improved model fit from R² = 66.6% → 69.5%  
- Visualized added-variable plots and regression diagnostics  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
R, Statsmodels, ggplot2, Base R functions
